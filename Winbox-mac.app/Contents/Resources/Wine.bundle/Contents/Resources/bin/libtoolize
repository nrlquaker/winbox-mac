## ----------------- ##

# Except for the global variables explicitly listed below, the following

# variables initialised in the 'Resource management' section, sourcing
# this file will not pollute your global namespace with anything
# else. There's no portable way to scope variables in Bourne shell
# though, so actually running these functions will sometimes place
# results into a variable named after the function, and often use
# temporary variables in the '^_G_' namespace. If you are careful to
# avoid using those namespaces casually in your sourcing script, things
# should continue to work as you expect. And, of course, you can freely
# overwrite any of the functions or variables defined here before
# calling anything to customize them.

# putting '$debug_cmd' at the start of all your functions, you can get

# This section contains definitions for functions that each ensure a
# particular resource (a file, or a non-empty configuration variable for
# example) is available, and if appropriate to extract default values
# from pertinent package files.  Where a variable already has a non-
# empty value (as set by the package's 'bootstrap.conf'), that value is
# used in preference to deriving the default. Call them using their
# associated 'require_*' variable to ensure that they are executed, at
# most, once.
#
# It's entirely deliberate that calling these functions can set
# variables that don't obey the namespace limitations obeyed by the rest
# of this file, in order that that they be as useful as possible to
# callers.

# particular resource (a file, or a non-empty configuration variable for
# example) is available, and if appropriate to extract default values
# from pertinent package files.  Where a variable already has a non-
# empty value (as set by the package's 'bootstrap.conf'), that value is
# used in preference to deriving the default. Call them using their
# associated 'require_*' variable to ensure that they are executed, at
# most, once.
#
# Some of the require functions are very similar, so we generate those
# as this file is sourced. They look complicated, but they are the same
# as normal function declarations wrapped in "eval '<definition>'", so
# that embedded single quotes need to be escaped, and wherever a symbol
# is generated, we drop out of the single quotes and expand a variable
# that holds the symbol.
#
# After that, the rest appear in asciibetical order.
